# Data Context Entities

This project implements entities maintained by the PhenoDCC tracking system. The
tracker maintains a history of all the data that have been collected and
processed by the Data Coordination Centre at [MRC Harwell](http://har.mrc.ac.uk/).
The `phenodcc_context` database keeps track of measurements that are both
valid and active. This is used by the data display and annotation generator
to discard invalid data.

_The database schema is defined elsewhere in the tracker system_.
